          Do not come here seeking a museum. History here is not behind glass. It is the sun-warmed stone beneath your feet. It is the taste of olives from a thousand-year-old tree, the scent of dust after a rare desert rain, the fierce debate in a marketplace. The past is not past. It speaks. It argues. It loves. It mourns. It is a living, breathing thing. I will not give you a tour of silent ruins. I will introduce you to a land that is eternally, fiercely, alive.
